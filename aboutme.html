            Hi there! My name's <b>Kevin Charles Green</b>, also known as <b>Doo</b> or <b>Lil' Kev</b>. I'm the youngest child and currently nineteen years old. I prefer monochromatic or dark shades of color over brighter ones, and my favorite/lucky number is 10. I'm a Christian and I go to Second Baptist Church. I think I'm a pretty open-minded person.

            I like to call myself an 'extroverted-introvert'. I tend to keep to myself, but if I want to talk to someone or someone wants to talk to me, I can conversate comfortably. I find it interesting to discover new ideas. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science in hopes of getting a career in programming. Generally, I'm very calm and collected, but on the inside it's completely different. Going back to the extroverted-introvert thing, I can get nervous when I'm talking to someone. I don't know why, though. I've also concluded that I have            
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_bitch_face' title='Resting Bitch Face'>RBF</a>.
            What that means is whenever I'm relaxed, in deep thought or just not expressing any particular emotion, I tend to look like I'm irritated or annoyed. Combined with my preference to keep to myself, others would find me hard to approach, and would be surprised when they found out my actual demeanor. Of course, I do like to tinker with computers. I'm probably going overboard with this site right now. But I also enjoy art. I like drawing, learning about art, and even digital art which combines my two interests. I like editing pictures to make (usually stupid) memes and such, as seen in some thumbnails.

            From Kindergarten to the middle of 3rd grade, I went to Alice Hart. It wasn't too bad, I had a lot of friends and the teachers were nice as well. But, that was Kindergarten through 2nd grade. In 3rd grade, it was terrible: the teacher I had made unreasonable and unnecessary rules. It was back when we only had one teacher who taught all subjects. Everyday I would get in trouble for bringing an extra pencil--yep. A pencil. Bear in mind, I got straight A's and never got into a situation where I lost a pencil. Because of this rule, I went to counseling a lot for no reason. Then there was this one time where I was framed for breaking the bathroom toilet (they didn't work in the first place); the teacher wouldn't even let me explain myself. My parents got angry when I got suspended for talking during lunch. Yeah, after a certain time, we're not allowed to talk, even lunch was the only time we could. Not all adults are smart. Rude? Maybe. True? Definitely.        </p>

                    Because of band, PT and drill, I was outside a lot, so I was very dark.

            I took the bus home and my grandpa would pick me up. My parents had enough when one very smart staff member told me to get on the wrong bus, even a 6-year-old me very much knew better. But because she was 'the adult' I had to listen. Unsurprisingly, I wound up being dropped off at a completely unknown area without phone or even any emergency contacts. The bus lady was nice and stayed with me, but she eventually had to go, but she dropped me off at the police station. I don't exactly remember how, but eventually my dad found me, and I told him what happened. The next day, he stormed the school and let's just say he didn't hold back his choice of words.        </p>

            After about a week I enrolled in Belle Chasse Academy in the naval base. It took a while but I was able to fit in quite well. The teachers and staff were respectful to the student as the students were to them and we actually had a say in matters regarding the school. Every year they held a talent show and performed in every one since I liked singing. In eighth grade, I decided to join their band. I played the cymbals. Apart from that I didn't do much at the school because I was more introverted at the time.        </p>

            After graduating from Belle Chasse, I enrolled in New Orleans Military and Maritime Academy. It was a military theme high-school located at Federal City, an old naval base that's been shut down. I say 'military-themed' because it wasn't a JROTC academy because it wasn't run by the military but a normal principal. The students, or cadets, had to wear Marine Corp uniforms. There were normal teachers as well as retired Marine Corps Instructors (they did NOT want to be teachers). As an introverted freshman, I was terrified, but I quickly found out that they weren't all bad. I was a 2nd Lieutenant before I graduated. By putting me through various situations like leadership positions and such, I was able to quickly break out of the shell if that makes any sense; I soon found it natural to speak with others, whether it be a fellow cadet, teacher, or an irritated Marine Instructor. I even got involved with the school more; I joined the drill team PT (Physical Training) team and the band. Unlike Belle Chasse, I played the snare (I sucked). I even got to go to Paris Island in South Carolina where I got a taste of what it's like to be a Marine recruit. It was quite fun, really. I was used to people screaming at me to the point where I found it funny (I laughed internally, of course). I'm thankful to that school for helping me be the person I am now.        </p>
