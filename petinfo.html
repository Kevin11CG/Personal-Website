            This is Skyy. We've had him since he was a little puppy. I was 9 years old and my big sister, Diamond, was still in high-school. She wanted to name him Snow at first but decided to call him Skyy. I secretly wanted to call him Exo because of a game I used to play.

            When he first got him he was still in his teething phase, but we didn't have any toys for him to gnaw on. Fortunately, he didn't gnaw on anything in the house. However, unfortunately, he liked to gnaw on me, specifically my fingers. He refused to use any toy we gave him because he was so used to teething on me and followed me around a lot.

            He's a quirky one and I'd always found him in the most bizarre of situations. He's alway making goofy faces. One time, he was messing with a cat. The cat must've scratched him in the eye because it was red when I came home. He can still see with it, luckily, but I'm pretty sure that's what made him cock-eyed. He learned his lesson that day. One notable quirk is that he likes to sit in dark rooms by himself, even if there are others in the house. There are countless times where he would scare the hell out of me when I walked into a room only to see glowing green eyes staring at me.

            We had other pets, but I was too young to remember them and we had them way before we got Skyy. Since we got him when he was a puppy, he still had to be neutered at one point, and boy, that was difficult. First, he may seem goofy and unaware, but it's the opposite; he's super aware of what we say. That makes giving him baths troublesome. When we took him to the vet, he knew something was up. He wasn't happy after visiting the vet, especially when we had to put the cone on him. Thinking back, he really put meaning in Mark's Twain's quote "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog" because it took two people to hold him and a third person to put the cone on him.
